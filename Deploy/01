# Create a bare git repository on the server:

git init --bare ~/www/.git

# This is not an ordinary, working, directory.
# This is only a git repository that stores the git revision history of the repo.
# Clone this repository on the local machine or add it as remote to you web application repo:

git clone ssh://roger@10.1f.x.y:1337/~/www/.git
# OR
git remote add prod roger@10.1f.x.y:1337/~/www/.git

# You can now push to the remote: make a first empty commit to test. 
# Now, we will create a hook script to add the changes to the server when pushing to master.
# Create a bash script file ~/www/hooks/post-receive on the server and add this script:

#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# post-receive hook
# Deploys to production after a push.
# Only the master reference will trigger a deployment.
