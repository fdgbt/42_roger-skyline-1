This project follows the 'Init' project, where some of basics commands and first reflexes in system and network administration are learned.  
This one will be a concrete example of the use of those commands and will conclude by starting a web server. 

# Expected Result
All the commands and scripts used in this project are uploaded in this repository.
They are structured following the subject requirements.
The complete process is described in a documentation that I initiated.

# OS Specification
The project has been firstly realised with the Arch Linux OS.
This Operating System was a good choice in term of pedagogy as you must go (very much) deaper in the OS installation.

# Special Docs
Following the great success of the initiative taken in the 'Init' project, a unique document (two in reality) has been created for this project, starting from scratch. 
In these rare documents you can follow the subject and a reminder for all notions learned, but also explanations for each scripts.  
It has been designed to be very complete in terms of informations, and represents dozens of hours of research and writing.  
It takes the form of a tutorial of 85 pages for the Arch Linux OS, and an other one of 30 pages for Debian OS.  
Both documents allow you to be guided step by step and to complete the project from A to Z.  
They can be shared individually upon request.  

I would like to thanks a lot the 42 peers (and friends) who helped me to produce this document: Julien B., Benjamin W., Sven B., Gautier L. and Radhoin H.
